The worst computer I have ever laid my eyes upon.
Firstly, it has no leds to let you know what is going on, no cap lock, no hard drive indicator, nothing.
Ok, one light to let you know if the damn thing is on.
The biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it, even when the strength bar is filled.
Also, when you try to download a large file, like a video, it will start out normally, downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec, making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless.

I have had the luxury (sarcasm) of owning 2 of these laptops.
The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.
During that time, I had to send it back 3 times.
I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.

None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.
They would repair one thing, send it back and it would still have the same problem.
The processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.

I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.
I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.
I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.
I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty.
I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.
I waited and waited and no laptop.
Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.
I waited another month for approval and for them to "BUILD" me a new laptop.
Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.
HP didn't fix it.
I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.
not durable .
slow processor, just not it

Im glad that it has such great features in it.
It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home.
Clear picture on it and everything.
The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here, it tends to freeze up sometimes, but thats the only bad thing about this computer.

I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box!
I have had nothing but problems since the day I took it out of the box!
My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall/Security program.
It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived.
It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.
Then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
Being only 2 months old, I am not a happy camper!
Buyer Beware.
this one, in my opinion, might be a lemon!
Other than a hate of windows 8, she just loves it.

very poor quality lap top....
I am returning it...
It crashes, and when it goes flat, it just DIES (like a PC, maybe worse) and I loose all my open documents!
I Hate it!
The Macbook is a fantastic laptop.
You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it.
The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot.
It just works flawlessly!
Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action.

The only objection I have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade.

My only concern is that since the battery is not external, I will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time.
I wonder if thats just Apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop 3-4 years from now lol.

It was too cheaply constructed.
It also gave me an introduction to Windows 8, which I hope will be discontinued it the future.
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.
the mouse buttons are hard to push.

If you're the type of person that just likes to browse the Internet and enjoy media and do light work with Microsoft office, this is the laptop for you.

A coupla months later, they change my hard drive.
A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.
Went silently.
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.
THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !
And I'm still paying the bloody financing, for a product which didn't last me at least three years !
I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied.
The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.
Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it.

That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.

It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.
ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.
To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.

I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.

Yet, HP won't do anything about the problem.
I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months.
When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.
So, you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item.
Currently if I use the laptop I can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs.
Well, they don't care a bunch.
But, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem.
I would  say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.
And, if you are going to deal with HP be careful.
In my house, HP is a nasty word.
If your on a budget.... Save up longer.
This laptop isn't worth a single cent.
I couldn't even install linux on it.
Windows runs very poorly.
Just save your money and get something better.

the screen/video resolution won't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
That being said, it still runs video in full screen decently.
The sound is a bit quiet if you're on a plane, this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.
Bottom line, I doubt you'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine.

No viruses.
I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free, even without the warranty.
A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense.
Its also FUN to use!
The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.

The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing.

Has a 5-6 hour battery life.

They are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat.

I burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there.
I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.
For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).
Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.
The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in.
returned it.
5 months dead again.
They say sorry out of warranty.
Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.
They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.
Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.

This is a great bargain.
Yes, it's running and old type processor so, hey, don't even try gaming on it.

I like everything about this laptop.
It has no way of connecting to the internet save wifi but that's all I use anyway!
I put that free app on for word processing and it works like a charm.
I plugged it into my existing printers and it just worked, no fuss no muss.
It immediately recognized the printer and was ready to go.
Excellent buy.
This is a great home computer.
It is very, very quiet.
The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is, I feel I have to reach so far to type on the key board.

Everything about this computer is easy to use.

The only thing is that the battery won't last more than 1/2 an hour.
It discharges too quickly.
Kind of annoying, but I still love the laptop.

It was over rated!
VERY disappointing:
I was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain Flash.
Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.
After purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.
I love this little one.
The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel.
Hands down one of my best and most used purchases thus far.
The Mid-2014 MacBook Pro does no disappoint...

The Windows 8.1 used to boot in just 2s and that was freaking awesome.
Now I have dual booted my laptop to Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 14.04 and it's not got too slow either.
I am loving it completely.
It does make a little noise but that's alright as it's not too much.
It doesn't get heated up much even after continuous usage.
But the  touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing, my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it's really annoying.

I prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad, i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else.

It started out getting hot after only a few months.
At 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes.
I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.
I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it.
I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room.

The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.
Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.

When I saw this I grabbed it.
It has met all my needs.
I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly dissatisfied with it.
The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning.
It freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it.
I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem.
Well, I started using Google Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.
This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.
Another issue I have with it is the battery.
Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.
There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: " Consider replacing your battery" and it does not hold full charge.

I'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC.
The benefits were immediate!
Awesome graphics!
The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation!
This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn't support)!

I've saved a lot of time and headaches so far, using my new MacBook Pro.
Let's just get this out of the way, I love Apple!
But the Macbook is the best!
It is super easy to use.
All you have to do is turn it on and it works.

It is very durable, I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet.
I don't do any high tech stuff on it, just write papers, check mail, and sometimes play games, so I can't reccomend it if you are in the computer field.
In the past four years I've had it I have never once gotten a virus.
I did have to replace the battery once, but that was only a couple months ago and it's been working perfect ever since.

I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro!
It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.
This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it!
The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile.

I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!
We are addicted to the Mac.
This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone.
The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it!

I just got this laptop for college, and so far I am very happy with it.
It is so much easier to use
I've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it!
In those three years, I've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily.
My power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership, so it was covered by the Applecare warranty plan.

I highly recommend this product!
Now that I have it I see that I really needed this for much more.
I run Dreamweaver, Final Cut Pro 7, Photoshop, Safari, Firefox, MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time.
I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.
I highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door.

I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.
I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.
I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.
So I'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.
I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I won't have to worry about a crash.
It's fast and has excellent battery life.

I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it!
It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to.
The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC.
five starts
For everyday use, you can't really go wrong with this laptop.
If, like me, you will be paying bills, occasionally reading the news, or just buying stuff on line, Then this is a winner.
If you are a gamer or need it for heavy computer use, get something else.
It's a good starter computer that is extremely light on the wallet.

From the start, when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine.
The ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it.
The screen is bright and clear, the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice.

I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent.
The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.
My laptop cost approximately $2,300 and DIED after only 2-years, 10-months and 18-days of use.

Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.
So I called Compaq, and after being on the phone for 3 hours, i finally got a replacement which I shouldn't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty.
2 months later, the battery went.
They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die.

THEN, one month after the warranty expired, the replacement charger went.
I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
Not worth it one bit.
The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.

Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose.
And it is impossible to get them back in.

The biggest problem I have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive.
I have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available, but nothing has helped.
Also, the touchpad is almost 'sticky', which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad.

Too often I would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet.
I was unable to download iTunes to it.
Dell support was awful to deal with.
And the settings are simply annoying.
Just not for me.
The HP Envy 15 has been everything I expected.
After doing much research for a laptop that had all the features I was looking for, This one hit all the criteria I had.
The laptop is very responsice with the Core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM and the sound out of the Beats audio is great.

The battery life is a joke and it's causing other problems.
I will be returning it.

The Toshiba Satellite laptop is  DESIGNED  to fail !
The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.
I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.
Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.
I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer.
The computer is so slow, even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up.
They said it was a computer error on this type of computer.
Also, I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.
When the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself.
Also, the battery does not last very long at all.
I would recommend not buying this product.
I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.
I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.
Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.

My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.

But here's something I hadn't realized before buying it: there isn't an optical drive, which means NO CDs or DVDs!
I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front.
I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen.
I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it.
One of them seems to have worked.
I never have had a good result with this computer.
I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not  what I've done.
The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.

I upgraded it's RAM to 2GB, I am very happy with it.
I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.
Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.
So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.
Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.
Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.
I cannot be happier with the service or product.

This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!
The DVD burner broke after burning 3 DVD'd during that time!
They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.
If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before!
I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person!
Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up!
I can guarantee this will be the last Dell I will ever purchase!

It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer, was a six month trial.
Also, the extended warranty was a problem.
The extended warranty for the $4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu.
Overall the computer is very easy to use, the screen is perfect, great computer, my daughter loves.

The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in.
I would like at least a 4 hr. battery life.
Otherwise, all other features are a 1

This is going to be random and unorganized, but here are my thoughts on the laptop:So far so good after a month.
It took some getting used to on the Widows 8.1, after being an XP user for many years.
Everything seems to be running smoothly.
Only downfall is the preloaded McAfee and other software.

With today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.

I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.
Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.

But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!
Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time.
This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
I'm tired of the inept service.
If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS!!!
Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.

I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst.
At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.

This computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.
Oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.

HP Pavilion DV9000 Notebook PC      When I first got this computer, it really rocked.
But as time went on I found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi.
Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on.

However, this laptop far exceeded my expectations when I bought it for college, I only use Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials, run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years.

For $250, which is as much as my graphics card alone cost, this laptop is an incredible value.
It is quite impressive at multitasking, which really surprised me.
I can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well.
BUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen, it's certainly good enough for the average person, but if you're used to good screens this may bother you a bit, but it's certainly not unbearable by anyone's standards.
If you want to game, this thing can handle League of Legends on medium-low settings, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for gaming.
Overall, a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web-browsing.
Would definitely recommend for those who are "technologically ignorant"
This laptop is amazing!
Windows 8.1 has its pros and cons.
The keyboard is backlit but you have to press the F5 key to turn it on.

I think this computer is super lame.
I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing.
I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it.
It doesnt work worth a damn.
The display is beyond horrible.
I can not even read what I am writing half of the time.
There are so many things wrong with this product, it just makes me want to set my self on fire!
I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.
Not to mention it has shit gigs.
I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage.
Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.

A great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.

I enjoy very much my new Toshiba, purchased specifially for attending online schooling.
I have found it very easy to use, very imformative, wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs.
I have found also, it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access; without having to have extra equipment and/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so.
I also love the small, convenient size of my laptop, making it a perfect tool for my academic studies.

The mouse is a little bit different than what you're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly.

Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.

The repairs were made quickly though I must say, however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.
Biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased.
This clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered.

It would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for 5 minutes.
The second one, after a little over a month, refused to turn on even with a full charge.

What a lemon!!
Shiny
This Laptop is the Best of the best!
The Awesomest of the awesomest.
It is so great, I can Hardly ever take my hands off it!
My friends are in awe every time they come over!
I got it for Christmas, and I was so excited to set it up!
It is super fast, and always loads.
I am just amazed.
The only bad part is the size/weight.
It's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's GREAT!

If you don't like fingerprints, this might not be the laptop for you.
It super shiny, so you can see the fingerprints easily.
All for such a great price.
It's color is even cool.
Another Great thing is the Beast graphics.
They are so realistic I am just speechless.
I let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease.
The cool thing about this is anyone can use it.
I don't know how I could ever live without my Qousmio.

This is without a doubt the worst laptop I've ever had.
And of course, the return window closed last week so now, I'm stuck with it.
I will never buy another Lenovo anything!

The touchpad hasn't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning, I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I've worked with have some inherent oddities.

I have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open!
Though I don't have much installed, I only have 96 of the 278G left!
I have no idea what's taking up all the room, it doesn't make sense.
I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, if you want to spend $400+ on a laptop, don't buy this one!

I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed.
Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.
And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended).
Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.

They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.
The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue.
Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to Louisville Ky.
And Toshiba is totally unconcerned.
The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.
We don't Mind and You don't Matter.
I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.

All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.
this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.
everything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.

Terribly slow...
Start up time took forever everything runs very slowly.
The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.
The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.

One year of trying to fix the computer by myself, with help of friends, and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it.

Those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall?
Yeah, I wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire.
That's how frustrating it was.

The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once, it never slows down.
It's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open.
It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box.

It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine.
It is a bit heavy.
It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required.
Had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in.
This is an over-sized, 18-inch laptop.
It wouldn't fit in most 17-inch bags.
I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard doesn't light up on this model.
It also does not have bluetooth.
You'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them.
I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing, I took it for granted that these features were standard.
Overall, still a very nice machine.
Boots up fast and runs great!

I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13" in April, and I loved it.
I was so happy with my new Mac.
Then the hard drive failed;
my information was all lost (my fault, I know, but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac, the paragon of all computers!
So, after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer, until it froze this morning--completely.
I can't even turn it off.
It's catatonic.
Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it's "like new," I might have 8 months next time.
I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.

Love it.
It dosn't even have a disc compartment
Supper east to use.
Retina display is beautiful.
Also very quick laptop!
Con: Hate that it has no disk drive.
This computer had exactly the specifications I needed.
Small enough to use on a long flight, Light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips.

When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed.
The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
Called tech support and got the usual Acer "We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you" I explained there was no software involved in booting.
No, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
Needless to say a PC that can't support a cell phone is less than useless!
the computer is very wonderful.
was not aware it did not have a disk drive when i bought it or i would not of purchased it.
it does have a habit of restarting itself when you try to do the log in pw. but over all. im very satisfied.

I'm very happy with my Acer, it does just for what I need it.
Even the sound is fantastic
I've had my Lenovo for a little over a month now and it does everything i want it to do and more.
i really have nothing negative to say about it.
The keyboard is a little wonky with having to use the Function button to get the F-keys but with how infrequently i use those it is a non-issue.

Lenovo is the best laptop.
Took it back as it was defective.
Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something.
Couldn't keep a page up you were working on!
Other than the slow CPU it works great for everyday use.

Heavy gaming is definitely not it's strong point.
The cover is a soft rubber texture without the friction.
Slick design and looks great.
This is a big disappointment.
I only use a laptop for personal use, but this one can't even handle that!
It takes a long time to load any page.
I've had it for a minth and so far it's shut down completely 3 times.

Let me tell you, this machine is great.
Purchased for development purposes, but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing, e-mail, etc.
I thought learning the Mac OS would be hard, but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC.
The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing.
The only time I have restarted is during system updates.
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one.
This computer is absolutely perfect for web browsing, watching video, word processing, and that's about it.
If you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video, this computer is NOT for you.
Now when I say don't expect to play games on it, I mean it.
Pretty much every major game save for Solitare won't even play on it due to the slower processor.
Pretty much every major game save for Solitare won't even play on it due to the slower processor.
Its also worth noting that there no bluetooth, no mircophone jack, no ethernet, no dvd/cd drive/burner, and no usb 3.0 ports.
It DOES come with two usb 2.0 ports, a hdmi port, and a webcam.
The webcam is nothing special, its there if you need it.
Don't expect it to take good pictures or video.
The battery is pretty soild.
It lasts up to 5-6 hours with normal use.
The computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch.
The only major negative to me is Windows 8.1 (though YMMV) and the Dell crapware installed.

I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb, 201
Ive had to call tech support many times.
Each time taking about 1 day or so.
I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly.
I had to pay for the shipping!
I will never buy anything from HP again!
What a great little laptop.
Maybe not the cutting edge (Satellite L455D) but it is a workhorse.

Only thing I would want to add to this is an internal bluray read/write drive.
But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.
Uhhhhhh, the computer looks good.
But, it works really slowwwwww!!!
It has got me feel like to take years to successfully open a web page.

From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer!

I bought it simply for Excel on Windows for work since I have a Macbook Air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening Excel or my web browser.
There is a chance mine is defective but regardless I'm not going to try another one this is a terrible product.
I'd much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for 2014.

Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop.
So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it...

The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.

The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.
Games being the main issue.
It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software.
Other than that I don't have one complaint in the world!
Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it.
Not good for a person who gets online daily.
May be better for the occasional web surfer.
The Notebook PC,Toshiba Qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me.
He gave me this PC about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it.
Its still going.

This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone.

First the screen goes completely out.
Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.
Now the screen is going darker, darker, darker.
HP is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.

They have held up well not just in our sales department, but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust, exhaust, grease, oil, and all manner of other non-computer-friendly substances.
GENERAL, a quality laptop.

This computer is great for someone who is looking to manage their online life(banling, facebook etc) and some basic offline work using MS Office.
the only drawback is no DVD player.. but for $20 you can buy an external one
Laptop is advertised as a 15" but the casing looks like that of a 17".
This laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases.

MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG. THE PRODUCT KEY.

It's A MAC!!
I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15" Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go.
I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races.
It's face and depanable.
As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....
it's just a great toy to have around.
When I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school, I had a hard time from beginning.
I feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plastic pieces would come off of it.
Ok, this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple.
The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.
The processor screams, and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.

I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one.
I like it so much, I bought another just for my wife.
The Computer Is Horrible Its To Slow.

It is very difficult to use this computer.
Too many steps to get anywhere and hard to set up
I tell everyone that I know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.
The computer blinks it shuts off at will.
The letter A stopped working after the first week.

when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.

they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem.
they have not sent a new one nor called.
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.

then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.
So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.
Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.
Very good price.
Very nice computer
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.

I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one.
Great for games
Right out of the box, this little netbook did everything I asked of it, including streaming the everyday video you're bound to encounter checking mail and websites (my biggest complaint previously).

The fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine.
The Windows 7 Starter is, in my opinion, a great way to think about using your netbook: basics, basics, basics.
I wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.

This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop (my wife and I have another laptop), or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks.
I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).

ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks, and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them.

Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.
Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.
Probbly the worst decision we ever made!
It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard!

pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.

i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.

So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
In two months, both the power cord pin broke (the company replaced it) and then the CD drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces.

In addition, no matter what I do to change the settings, add/delete Flash, etc., Firefox hangs on start-up.
It seems like Lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on.

The cords always feel like they are in my way.
One positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard, which is larger than usual.
It's a pleasure to type on.
My final thoughts: if you are a Mac user, stay away.
If you want to travel with this laptop, don't buy it.
It's clunky, heavy, and a pain to start up and shut down.

This netbook went bad on me after 3 days.
There is a blank lighted screen when I start and that is all.
The price and features more than met my needs.

It runs very quiet too which is a plus.
The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.
They only stay charged a little over an hour.
Laptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?

Dealing with HP support is a ridiculous and painful experience.
I have spent more than 2.5 hours on the phone with them (over 4 different calls), only to get no where.
Now I'm looking into the return process, which I'm sure will just be loads of fun, if my prior experience is any indication.
Seriously, save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company.
Used to love HP products, but this has soured me on the whole company.
